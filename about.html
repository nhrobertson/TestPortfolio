        <h4>Education</h4>
        <p>
            As of this moment, I am currently a student at the University of South Carolina focusing on obtaining
            a Degree in Computer Engineering! I focus on studying ways of implementing practical uses of software, mainly
            written with <span id="c++">C++</span>. I have worked in many labs, using electrical science to create circuits and
            have worked with <span id="ros">ROS and ROSPY</span> on the notorious DuckieBot. I will be graduating in 2024!

        <h4>Leadership Experience</h4>
        <p>
            I am currently a part of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity which has helped me hone my leadership skills.
            I work as the Fundraising Chair and have helped lead many events that has helped raise money for <a href="https://livelikelou.org/" id="lll">Live Like Lou</a>
            Other than that I always try to take a helpful role when in teams and have managed to enable my fellow students by setting up group
            projects and being a lead communicator.

    <div class="history">
        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>I grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina in Summerfield North. I attended Our Lady of Lourdes Elementary and Middle School and graduated
            from Cardinal Gibbons High School in 2020. I graduated being as a part of the National Honors Society. It was a little funky graduating
            during Covid however I believe it made me love operating computers even more!
